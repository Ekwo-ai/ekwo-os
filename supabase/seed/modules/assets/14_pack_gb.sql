-- Ekwo OS — United Kingdom: how this country depreciates and derecognises a fixed asset.

-- Generated from packs/gb/assets.json at version 0.8.0, do not edit.
-- Change the pack and run `ekwo pack build gb`; `ekwo pack check --all`
-- refuses a seed that is not the exact output of its pack, and the CI runs it.
--
-- Applied by the module migration runner — `ekwo migrate`, or `ekwo module
-- migrate` — and never by the socle seed step: these tables exist only on an
-- installation that carries the `assets` module.
--
-- The accounts a disposal lands on are not here. They are roles of the chart,
-- in `country_defaults`, written by the pack seed beside every other role.
