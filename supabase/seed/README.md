# `supabase/seed/` — reference data

Rows, not code. Everything here is plain SQL and safe to apply twice: the
currencies insert `on conflict do nothing`, and every other row here — the
territories and everything a country pack writes — upserts on its natural key,
so re-applying a seed is how a correction reaches an installation that already
exists.

## What is here

| File | Content | Applied by default |
|---|---|---|
| `00_currencies.sql` | The ISO 4217 currencies the packs name, each with the number of decimals it is rounded at. A pack whose currency is not here adds its row | yes |
| `00_territories.sql` | The territories of the common system of VAT: the 27 Member States with the day each became bound, the United Kingdom with the day it stopped being, Northern Ireland, the territories articles 6 and 7 of Directive 2006/112/EC take out of the system or put into it, and the VAT prefixes that are not ISO codes — plus a row, outside the system, for each country a pack outside it names. Read by `ec_sales_list()`, which refuses to write a statement when the file has not been applied | yes |
| `05_framework_generic.sql` | **Generated from `packs/generic`.** Two country-less financial statements, `IFRS-SME-BS` and `IFRS-SME-IS`, whose rules are all account types: they fit any chart of any country, and they are the fallback for a chart that names no statement of its own | yes |
| `<n>_pack_<cc>.sql`, one per pack | **Generated from `packs/<cc>`.** Its charts of accounts, its journals, its taxes with their postings, the boxes of its periodic declaration, its financial statements, the legal mentions, the account roles and the labels in every language it publishes. `<n>` is the number the pack declares in `seed_sequence`, so that adding a country renames nobody. The [table of packs](../../docs/packs.md#the-packs-of-this-checkout) — generated too — gives each pack's file | yes |
| `modules/assets/<n>_pack_<cc>.sql`, where the pack has an `assets.json` | **Generated from `packs/<cc>/assets.json`.** The fixed-asset rules of one country: how it prorates a first period, whether its declining balance is capped, how it derecognises an asset, and the usual duration of each kind of asset | **no** — applied by the module migration runner |
| `90_demo_company.sql` | A fictional company, « Exemple Conseil SRL », with contacts, four catalogue products, posted documents, a matched payment and a bank statement | **no** — sample data only |

## The order they are applied in, and by whom

The files applied by default — every `.sql` of this folder but the demo — are
applied **in file-name order**, and the
order matters twice: the currencies exist before a pack names one, and the
generic framework exists before a chart falls back to it. The territories
answer to nobody in this folder and are read only at run time, so where they
sit is a matter of reading order and not of dependency.

| Who | What it applies |
|---|---|
| `ekwo init` and `ekwo migrate` | every default file, in order. `90_demo_company.sql` never, unless `--demo` or `ekwo demo` asks for it |
| `supabase db push` / `supabase start` | the same files: `config.toml` lists exactly them under `[db.seed].sql_paths`, a list `ekwo pack build` writes |
| by hand | `psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f supabase/seed/<file>` for each of them, in order — the root README carries the lines, written by the same command |
| `ekwo migrate` and `ekwo module migrate` | the files under `modules/`, and only for the modules that installation carries |

`modules/` is deliberately out of `config.toml`, and out of the flat read this
folder gets everywhere else. `assets.category_templates` exists only on an
installation that carries the `assets` module, and a seed applied where its
tables are missing is a seed nobody can re-run.

A test installs the release both ways — through the CLI's runner, and the way
`supabase db push` and `psql -f` do — and compares every row of every table
these files write. The two paths agree byte for byte, which is what lets the
documentation say they are interchangeable.

## Most of these files are generated

`05_framework_generic.sql`, every `<n>_pack_<cc>.sql` and everything under
`modules/` are build artefacts, like `docs/schema.md`.

**Do not edit them.** Change `packs/<cc>/` and run `ekwo pack build --all`.
`ekwo pack check --all` refuses a seed that is not the exact output of its
pack, and the CI runs it on every push, so an edit here is caught rather than
shipped. [`docs/packs.md`](../../docs/packs.md) is the pack format and the
whole list of what `check` refuses.

One thing to know while you work: each generated pack seed carries a sha256 of
every file of its pack, so changing **any** file under `packs/<cc>/` — including
one the compiler never reads — makes the committed seed stale. Build again and
commit the result.

The four files the packs replaced — `10_chart_be.sql`, `11_chart_fr.sql`,
`20_taxes_be.sql`, `21_taxes_fr.sql` — are kept in
`tests/fixtures/seeds-before-packs/`, where a test loads them into one database
and the generated pair into another and compares every template row.

## What the generated files fill

The *template* tables, and nothing that belongs to a company — plus the two
reference tables of the framework, `currencies` and `territories`, which no
pack writes and no company owns:
`chart_templates`, `account_templates`, `journal_templates`, `tax_templates`,
`tax_posting_templates`, `country_defaults`, `country_packs` and
`legal_mention_templates`; the two declaration-form tables,
`tax_report_templates` and `tax_report_box_templates`; and the three statement
tables, `statement_templates`, `statement_line_templates` and
`statement_line_rules`.

A company gets its own copy of the templates when
`install_country_template(company_id, 'BE')` runs — on the chart it names, or
the default one. The form and the statements are read where they are, because
neither a declaration form nor the scheme a national bank prints is something a
company customises.

Changing a pack changes what future companies receive. It does not touch a
company that already exists: `ekwo pack upgrade` is what moves one, and it
applies an addition and a closed validity by itself and lists everything else
for a person to decide.

## What to check before you rely on the tax files

A pack is a reading of the rules at a date; you are responsible for what you
file. See [DISCLAIMER.md](../../DISCLAIMER.md).

The boxes and the lines are a **working starting point, not a legal opinion**.
Every tax and every box names the text it comes from (`legal_reference`, a
required field), and each manifest carries a certification status — the
[table of packs](../../docs/packs.md#the-packs-of-this-checkout) gives each
one's. `maintained` means kept up to date by the maintainers and not yet read
by an accountant; `community` means not read by an accountant either. In the
two `maintained` packs, four mappings are known to want a professional's eye:

- Belgium: credit notes on intra-community purchases (box 84 with 62 and 63).
- France: line 13 of the CA3 (the 2.1 % rate as a special rate).
- France: line 01 can come out negative when a quarter's credit notes exceed
  its sales, because it is derived from the taxable bases.
- France: line 08 does not tie to itself on an intra-Union acquisition, whose
  base goes to line 03 and whose tax goes to line 08.

The last two were found by the golden scenario on the day it shipped and are
written up in [`docs/decisions.md`](../../docs/decisions.md); they are reported
rather than patched away, because adjusting a golden until it passes is how a
bug gets recorded as a fact.

If you find a wrong box, change the posting in `packs/<cc>/taxes.json`, run
`ekwo pack build <cc>`, and add a test in `tests/reporting.test.ts` that pins
the corrected amount.

## Products in the demo, and none in the country files

The country files seed no product, and they never will: what a business sells is
not a country rule. The demo company carries four — a consulting day priced in
`DAY`, a workshop, a monthly support in `MON` and a printed brochure at the
reduced rate — because a product is worth seeing in use, and three of the demo
invoices are written from them. They are inserted `on conflict (company_id,
code) do nothing`, like everything else here.

## Adding a country

Not here: in `packs/<cc>/`, then `ekwo pack build <cc>`, which writes the seed
here and adds it to `config.toml` and to the README. [`docs/packs.md`](../../docs/packs.md) walks through the
whole day, and `ekwo pack check` is what tells you whether you are still on the
path.
