/**
 * The language a document was written in.
 *
 * Until `documents.language` existed the answer was re-derived on every read,
 * from the customer's preference, then the company's, then the pack's — so a
 * customer who switched language rewrote every invoice ever sent to them, legal
 * mentions included. These tests hold the two halves of the fix: the chain
 * still decides, and it decides once.
 *
 * A draft is the part that keeps moving. It carries no number and no entry, the
 * customer on it may still change, and so may that customer's own language;
 * until it is posted, its language is whatever the chain answers today. The
 * moment it is posted the column stops, and the guard says so by name.
 *
 * Every expectation here comes from a pack — which languages it publishes,
 * which sentence its law puts at the foot of what a seller issues, which
 * account its manifest names for a sale. A country is named where a scenario is
 * set up and nowhere else.
