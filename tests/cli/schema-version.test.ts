/**
 * The version a release declares, and the two places it has to appear.
 *
 * `ekwo_schema_version()` is what the migrations define. `instance.schema_version`
 * is what the installation believes it runs. They are written at different
 * moments — one by a migration, one by the installer or by `ekwo migrate` —
 * and a release that bumps the first and not the second leaves every existing
 * installation naming a version it no longer has, which is the number a client
 * refuses an old database on.
 *
 * The expected version is written out rather than read from the function,
 * because a test that asks the code what it says proves nothing. Bumping it is
 * part of cutting a release; `docs/releasing.md` says so in order.
