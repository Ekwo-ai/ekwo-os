/**
 * One rounding rule, in three copies that have to stay identical.
 *
 * Before 13 September 2026 the three packages answered this differently:
 * `factur-x` added an epsilon and rounded, `xbrl-cbso` rounded without one,
 * and the MCP server (whose copy now lives in the core, where the command line reads it too) used `toFixed(2)`. The three disagree on exactly the two
 * cases a ledger meets — a negative half, where `Math.round` goes towards
 * positive infinity and turns -0.005 into -0.00, and a value a binary float
 * cannot hold, where 2.675 becomes 2.67 because `2.675 * 100` is really
 * 267.49999999999994.
 *
 * A format brick may not import the core or another brick, so the rule cannot
 * be shared as code. It is duplicated, and this file is what keeps the copies
 * honest: the same vector is run through all three, and the three source
 * files are compared byte for byte. The vector itself lives in
 * `helpers/rounding-vector.ts`, because `currency_rounding.test.ts` runs the
 * same one through the SQL function and compares the two answers.
