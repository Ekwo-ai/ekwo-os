/**
 * One release, two install paths, and the same books at the end.
 *
 * A user has two ways in. `npx ekwo-os init` runs the CLI's own migration runner
 * and its own seed loader. `supabase db push` followed by `psql -f` runs
 * neither: the Supabase CLI reads the same folder of `.sql` files and writes
 * the same history table, and the operator applies the seeds by hand. The
 * README documents both and calls them interchangeable.
 *
 * "Interchangeable" is a claim about the state of a database, so this file
 * builds one of each and compares them. Not a row count — a chart with the
 * right number of wrong accounts passes a row count — but every row of every
 * table the seeds write, rendered as JSON and sorted, character for character.
 *
 * The second path is deliberately written without importing anything from
 * `packages/cli`: it applies the files in filename order and records the
 * history itself. A test that drove both paths through the same runner would
 * prove that the runner is deterministic, which nobody doubted.
