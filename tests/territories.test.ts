/**
 * `territories` — where the core keeps what it used to guess.
 *
 * Two questions were asked of every line of a recapitulative statement and had
 * no answer anywhere in this repository: whether the customer's country is
 * inside the common system of VAT, and which two letters their VAT
 * identification numbers carry. `docs/international.md` recorded both, and the
 * answer to both is this table.
 *
 * What is proved here is the table and the three functions that read it, and
 * not the countries: almost nothing below names one. Where a row is named it
 * is because the row *is* the claim — that Greece identifies under a prefix
 * that is not its ISO code is a fact about Greece and about nothing else — and
 * the line says so.
 *
 * Four groups:
 *
 *   1. the rows are there, and they are there without a seed file;
 *   2. they are internally consistent — a parent that exists, a window that is
 *      ordered, a source on every one of them;
 *   3. the functions answer the questions they were written for, including at
 *      a date that is not today;
 *   4. the table is reference data with the rights of reference data.
