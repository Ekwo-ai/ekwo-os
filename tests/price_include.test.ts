/**
 * A price that already holds its tax.
 *
 * `taxes.price_include` had been a column since the tax engine landed and was
 * read by nothing: a line carrying such a tax was booked with the tax added on
 * top of a price the customer had already paid. What is proved here:
 *
 *   1. the gross is converted per **tax group**, not per line — the tax
 *      rounded once as BR-CO-14 requires, the base the gross less that tax, so
 *      the total is the price that was quoted, to the unit, always;
 *   2. the base is shared over the lines in proportion to their gross and the
 *      last line takes the remainder, so the lines add up to the group;
 *   3. a discount applies to the gross, before the conversion;
 *   4. the flag is snapshotted on the line and frozen when the document is
 *      posted, so changing the tax cannot rewrite an invoice that was sent;
 *   5. the three refusals — a fixed-amount tax, a line with no tax, a group
 *      that is half inclusive — each answer by name;
 *   6. an invoice behind a share link says which price it is showing;
 *   7. none of it assumes a currency with cents.
 *
 * The pack under test is whichever one prices with the tax in it, and the rate
 * and the account come from that pack's own files: nothing here names a
 * country.
