/**
 * The golden test of every country pack, replayed by one runner.
 *
 * A pack is data, and data that compiles says nothing about whether it adds
 * up. A declaration box that sums the wrong postings and a tax that posts to
 * the wrong box agree with each other: the seed builds, every unit test
 * passes, and the return is wrong. What catches that is a year of books whose
 * result somebody wrote down — `packs/<cc>/golden/`, a scenario and, beside
 * it, the declaration, the statements and the trial balance it produces, to
 * the cent.
 *
 * Nothing here knows a country. The runner reads `packs/`, installs a company
 * on each pack from what its own scenario declares, replays the documents and
 * the payments through the real functions — `post_document`, `post_payment`,
 * `reconcile` — and compares `vat_return`, `financial_statement` and
 * `trial_balance` against the files. A pack with no scenario and no declared
 * exemption never reaches this file: `readPack` refuses it, so `ekwo pack
 * check` and the CI refuse it too.
 *
 * What it proves is internal coherence and not legal truth, which no test can
 * reach. That is what the legal source on every tax and every box is for, and
 * what `certification.status` says out loud.
 *
 * To rewrite the expectations after a deliberate change:
 *
 *     UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 npm test -- tests/golden.test.ts
 *
 * It rewrites the three expectation files and never the scenario: a runner
 * that could rewrite its own inputs proves nothing. The diff is then the
 * thing to review.
