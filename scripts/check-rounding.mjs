/**
 * Refuses a new migration that rounds a money amount to a hard-coded number of
 * decimals.
 *
 * Since `20260914120500_rounding_reads_the_currency`, the decimals of an
 * amount come from `currencies.decimal_places` and the method from
 * `country_defaults.rounding_method`, through one function:
 *
 *     round_amount(amount, rounding_of(company_id, currency_code))
 *
 * A `round(x, 2)` written anywhere else is the bug that migration exists to
 * remove — right for the euro, wrong for the yen, which has no decimals, and
 * for the dinar, which has three. So is a cast to `numeric(n, 2)`, which
 * rounds just as silently while looking like a type.
 *
 * The check runs on migrations *newer than* that one, because a published
 * migration is never edited: the fifty-one calls that were there before are
 * history, and what replaced them is what the database now runs. The live
 * definitions are checked from the catalogue instead, in
 * `tests/currency_rounding.test.ts` — that test is the other half of this one
 * and neither replaces the other.
 *
 * Run with `npm run check:rounding`; CI runs it on every push.
