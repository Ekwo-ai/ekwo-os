/**
 * `ekwo.json` — the one file the CLI writes, and what is deliberately not in it.
 *
 * It describes the installation, and holds two things: which Supabase project
 * it is on, and which schema version it was at. That is enough for the next
 * `ekwo status` or `ekwo migrate` to know where it is pointed without being
 * told again.
 *
 * It names no country. An installation holds companies of several countries,
 * and each company carries its own; the company the next commands act on is
 * the one `ekwo use` picked, kept with the session and not here. Files written by
 * 0.6 and earlier carry a `country` key — the country of the first company — and
 * are still read: the key is left where it is and taken for nothing, so an
 * older file keeps working and the next `ekwo init` writes it without one.
 *
 * It holds no password, no service_role key and no connection string with
 * credentials in it. Those are given per invocation, by flag, environment
 * variable or prompt, and they are never written down here. A file that is
 * safe to commit is a file that stays useful; a file with a key in it becomes
 * a leak the first time somebody commits it.
