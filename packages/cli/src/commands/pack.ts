/**
 * `ekwo pack` — the country packs, in this repository and in an installation.
 *
 *   ekwo pack build <cc>|--all   compile packs/<cc> into supabase/seed/
 *   ekwo pack check <cc>|--all   recompile in memory and refuse a stale seed
 *   ekwo pack check --links      … and open the source register's URLs
 *   ekwo pack list               what this checkout carries
 *   ekwo pack status             what an installation holds, company by company
 *   ekwo pack upgrade <company>  move a company to the version loaded here
 *
 * The first three are files in, one SQL file out: no database, no network, and
 * they only run in a checkout, because a published installation has the
 * compiled seeds and no pack to compile. `--links` is the one exception and it
 * is an option for exactly that reason: it reaches the publishers a register
 * names, reports what did not answer, and decides nothing. The last two are
 * the opposite — they need a connection and know nothing about `packs/`.

 * refuses a request with no browser behind it, Riigi Teataja serves the same
 * page shell for a text and for a typo, and a ministry moves a form the week
 * before a deadline. A gate that turned any of those into a red build would
 * make every contributor's pull request fail for something nobody in it did,
 * and the fix would be to delete the link.
 *
 * It also reaches the network, which `pack build`, `pack check` and everything
 * else under `packs/` deliberately do not: they are files in, one SQL file out.
 * An option is how that stays true of the command and available to a person.
 *
 * So what it reports is a reading, not a verdict: a maintainer runs it when
 * they refresh a pack, reads what did not answer, and opens the ones that look
 * real. A HEAD is tried first and a GET follows, because some publishers
 * answer one and not the other.
