/**
 * What a treatment obliges a tax to say on an invoice, and where.
 *
 * A tax carries three things that are three tellings of one fact: its
 * `treatment`, which is Ekwo's own word for what the operation is; its
 * `vat_category`, which is BT-118 and BT-151 of EN 16931, taken from the
 * UNCL5305 subset the standard publishes; and its `exemption_code`, which is
 * BT-121, taken from the VATEX list. Nothing until now compared them, so a
 * pack could declare an export taxed at the standard rate, or an
 * intra-Community supply with the reverse-charge reason code, and every test
 * in the repository would pass — because neither column is read by the ledger
 * or by the declaration. They are read by whoever renders the invoice, which
 * is the one reader that is not in this repository.
 *
 * The tables below are transcribed, not decided. Three sources say all of it:
 *
 * - **UNCL5305 (UN/CEFACT D.16B, OpenPEPPOL subset)** for what each category
 *   code means. `K` is *VAT exempt for EEA intra-community supply of goods and
 *   services* — goods **and services**, which is what settles the question the
 *   Ekwo vocabulary asks twice; `AE` is *VAT reverse charge*; `G` is *free
 *   export item, VAT not charged*; `O` is *services outside scope of tax*.
 * - **Technical guidance for tax codes in EN 16931, version 1** (European
 *   Commission, Technical Advisory Group on Electronic Invoicing, use cases
 *   dated 1 July 2024), whose six use cases give the pair to use for each
 *   case: exemption in general `E` + a VATEX code, intra-Community supply
 *   between Member States `K` + `VATEX-EU-IC`, reverse charge **within** a
 *   Member State `AE` + `VATEX-EU-AE`, and the case it calls export outside the
 *   Union `G` + `VATEX-EU-G` — which is the Union's border because the seller
 *   the guidance addresses is established in a Member State. What UNCL5305
 *   itself says of `G` is *free export item, VAT not charged*: the goods leave
 *   the territory of whoever levies the tax.
 * - **The VATEX code list itself**, which carries the pairing as a remark on
 *   eight of its codes: `VATEX-EU-AE` *only use with category code AE*,
 *   `VATEX-EU-IC` with `K`, `VATEX-EU-G` with `G`, `VATEX-EU-O` with `O`, and
 *   `VATEX-EU-D`, `-F`, `-I`, `-J` with `E`.
 *
 * Four decisions were taken where the sources leave a choice, and all four are
 * written up in `docs/packs.md`.
 *
 * **The table above is the Union's, and it applies where the Union's VAT
 * does.** EN 16931 is a European standard and the VATEX list is published by
 * the European Commission: its own codes name articles of Directive
 * 2006/112/EC and its national codes belong to Member States that publish
 * them. A pack for a country the common system does not reach may therefore
 * carry no code from it — `VATEX-EU-G` on an export from a third country
 * claims an article of the Directive that does not bind the seller — and what
 * an exempt line states there is its own article, in `legal_reference`, with
 * BT-121 left empty. The categories are unaffected: UNCL5305 is a UN/CEFACT
 * list, `E`, `G`, `O` and `AE` keep their meanings, and a pack outside the
 * Union goes on being held to them. The treatments of the common system
 * itself — the five `intracom_*` values — are refused there outright, because
 * an intra-Community supply is an operation of a system the country is not in.
 * Whether it is in it is not a fact this file holds: it is a row of
 * `territories`, read through `./territories.js`, on the day the pack's
 * manifest says it speaks of.
 *
 * **A category is required where a category is read.** The rule above says
 * what a category may be, and it holds everywhere. What does not is the
 * obligation to name one: BT-151 is a term of an invoice governed by EN 16931,
 * and the first pack of a country that levies no value added tax was asked for
 * one on every tax that can reach a sale although no American invoice carries
 * the field, no administration there publishes a category list, and nobody
 * would have read the answer. So the requirement is asked where the invoice
 * exists — inside the common system, or where the pack declares an e-invoicing
 * profile, each of which carries BT-151 — and `readsCategories` is the
 * caller's answer. Outside both, the column is free and everything it may say
 * is unchanged: a value that contradicts the treatment is refused there
 * exactly as it is here. This is the same border ST38-1 drew for the reason
 * code, one field over: the Union's lists reach the packs the Union's law
 * reaches.
 *
 * **A category is a term of the invoice, so on a purchase it is the
 * supplier's.** An Ekwo purchase tax describes how the buyer books and
 * declares somebody else's invoice; BT-151 on that invoice was chosen by the
 * seller. An intra-Community acquisition is therefore `K`, because the
 * supplier made an intra-Community supply and rule BR-IC-10 binds them to `K`
 * and `VATEX-EU-IC` — not `AE`, which is the guidance's case for a reverse
 * charge *within* one Member State. A pack that does not want to record the
 * seller's category may leave it null on a purchase-only tax; a value that
 * contradicts the treatment is refused either way.
 *
 * **Where no invoice governed by the standard exists, the category is
 * absent.** An import of goods is assessed on a customs document, and a
 * service received from a supplier the Union's rules do not reach comes on an
 * invoice the Directive does not govern. There is no seller's category to
 * record, so `import` and `foreign_services_received` carry none: `S` there
 * would claim the supplier levied the standard rate, which is the one thing
 * that certainly did not happen.
 *
 * **A triangular supply is `K`, not `AE`.** The guidance gives `AE` for a
 * reverse charge *within* one Member State, where the supplier is established
 * in the buyer's country and national law moves the liability. The middle
 * supply of a triangular arrangement is the opposite shape: the goods leave
 * the seller's State, article 141 of Directive 2006/112/EC relieves the seller
 * of registering where they arrive, and article 197 puts the tax on a customer
 * in a third State. What the line is, in the words of UNCL5305, is *VAT exempt
 * for EEA intra-community supply of goods and services* — `K`, with
 * `VATEX-EU-IC`, which the VATEX list reserves for it. That the *sentence* on
 * that invoice is the reverse-charge one is a different question in a different
 * vocabulary, and it is answered by `applies_when`.
 *
 * The rate is checked on the sale side only. On a sale the pack's `rate` is
 * the BT-152 the seller prints, and the business rules of EN 16931 fix it per
 * category — BR-S-05 wants a standard-rated line above zero, BR-Z-05,
 * BR-E-05, BR-AE-05, BR-IC-05, BR-G-05 and BR-O-05 want zero everywhere else.
 * On a purchase the rate is the one the buyer self-assesses at, which is
 * 21 % on a line the supplier invoiced at zero, so the same rule applied there
 * would refuse every reverse charge in every pack.
 *
 * What this does **not** do is hold a copy of the VATEX list. The list grows,
 * two published renderings of it already disagree on which codes it holds, and
 * a code this file has not heard of is not a contradiction — it is a code this
 * file has not heard of. So an exemption code is checked for its shape, and
 * for the pairings the list itself states.
 *
 * The same limit applies to the other end. No country outside the Union
 * publishes a list of exemption reason codes today; one may, and PINT is where
 * it would surface. So the field is provided for and the content is not: a pack
 * outside the common system may carry a reason code that is not a VATEX one,
 * on the condition that its register declares a published list — the entry of
 * `certification.sources` that says so of itself, with `reason_codes`. What is
 * checked is that a list is named, not that the code is in it, which is exactly
 * what is checked of a VATEX code inside the Union.
 *
 * That flag is new and it closes a trap. `reasonList` used to be the title of
 * the **first** entry whose `kind` was `standard`, and `standard` means "a
 * technical norm or code list" — which the FASB Accounting Standards
 * Codification and FRS 102 both are. Naming an accounting standard therefore
 * authorised a reason code on any tax of the pack, silently, in declaration
 * order. No pack ever carried one and nothing wrong was emitted; an entry now
 * says which list it is, and `ekwo pack check` refuses a second one.
