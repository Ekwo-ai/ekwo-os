/**
 * Which VAT the country of a pack levies, as the three code lists see it.
 *
 * Two of those lists are the Union's — EN 16931 is a European standard and the
 * VATEX list is published by the European Commission — so whether a pack may
 * carry a code from them is a question about its country. The answer is a row
 * of `territories`, read from the seed the database reads, and never a country
 * written into this repository's code.
 *
 * **The day is the pack's `released_at`, not today.** A pack is a transcription
 * of a country's law, and `released_at` is the day it says that transcription
 * is true; it is in the manifest, it is inside the pack's checksum, and asking
 * it makes `ekwo pack check` answer the same thing about the same commit for
 * ever. Today would not: a pack that passes in the morning and fails in the
 * evening with nothing committed in between is the one thing a check must
 * never be, and the day a State acceded or left is exactly when it would
 * happen. A tax's own `valid_from` would be worse still — the taxes of a pack
 * span decades, so one pack would speak two regimes at once and a British rate
 * of 1994 would be asked for a VATEX code from a list that did not exist. A
 * pack whose manifest names no day falls back on today, because a pack that
 * does not say when it speaks of is speaking of now.
 *
 * **A table that says nothing is not a table saying no.** `eu_vat_scope_of()`
 * answers `none` for a code it does not carry, which is right for its own
 * question — a supply to a place the Union has never heard of is not an
 * intra-Community one. It is not right for this one. Every refusal below
 * *narrows* what a pack may say, and narrowing on the strength of a missing
 * row would refuse a valid pack for a country somebody has not added to the
 * reference data yet. So a country the table carries no row for is held to the
 * table as published — the Union's — and the gap is closed where it belongs:
 * `tests/territories.test.ts` refuses a pack of this repository whose country
 * is not in `territories`, and the test beside it says the same of the seed the
 * CLI reads.
 *
 * `full` and nothing else counts as being in the system **for a pack**. The
 * third value, `goods`, is Northern Ireland, and it is not a fact about a pack
 * at all: the Union's rules reach goods there and not services, so half the
 * table applies and which half depends on the tax. A pack whose country is
 * such a territory is therefore still held to the rules of a country outside
 * the system, which refuses a code rather than accepting a wrong one — and a
 * *tax* that names the territory it applies in is judged on that territory
 * instead, by `regimeOfTerritory` below.
 *
 * **Whether BT-151 is read is a second question, and the manifest answers the
 * other half of it.** The category codes are UNCL5305, a UN/CEFACT list, and
 * they hold wherever a pack is; being *asked* for one is about whether an
 * invoice governed by the standard exists. Inside the common system it does.
 * Outside it, it does where the pack declares an e-invoicing profile —
 * `peppol-bis-3`, `factur-x-en16931`, `xrechnung`, a PINT — every one of which
 * is built on the semantic model of EN 16931 and carries the field. Where the
 * pack declares neither, as the first pack of a country with no value added
 * tax did, nothing reads BT-151 and nothing demands it.
 *
 * **Which list a reason code may come from is named by the entry itself.**
 * `reasonList` was the title of the first entry of the register whose `kind`
 * was `standard`, and `standard` covers a code list *and* an accounting
 * standard, so a pack naming FRS 102 or the FASB Codification was silently
 * declaring a list of exemption reason codes. An entry now says so with
 * `reason_codes`, at most one per pack, and `sourceRegister` refuses the rest.

/**
 * The source register, and every reference the pack makes to it.
 *
 * `legal_reference` says which article a rule comes from and has been required
 * on a tax and on a box since the format existed. What it never said is where
 * that article can be read, so a reviewer opening a pack had a citation and a
 * search engine. The register answers that once — a key, a title, the official
 * publisher, an absolute link and the day somebody opened it — and every rule
 * names a key instead of repeating a URL.
 *
 * Four things are refused here, and one is only warned about.
 *
 * A **duplicate key** is refused, because a reference would resolve to
 * whichever entry happened to come first. A **key nothing declares** is
 * refused: it reads as a source and is a typo. A pack that is not `community`
 * and carries **no entry at all** is refused, because `maintained` and
 * `reviewed` are claims that somebody keeps this current, and neither is
 * sayable about a list of titles. And on a **reviewed** pack every tax and
 * every box has to name a key — the reviewer read something, and this is where
 * they say what.
 *
 * On a `maintained` pack that last one is a warning. The register arrived
 * after four packs did; failing them the day it landed would have made the
 * feature the reason the repository was red, and the gap it names is a link
 * that is missing, never a figure that is wrong.
 *
 * The shape of an entry — the fields, the key, the https URL, the closed
 * vocabulary of `kind` — is the published schema's job and is checked there,
 * so an editor validating against `pack.1.json` refuses the same things.

 * the schema: a territory code nobody can look up is a string, and a string is
 * what `jurisdiction` has been since the day it was added — four packs could
 * have spelled California four ways and nothing would have said so.
 *
 * The second is `jurisdiction` itself, now that there is a table to check it
 * against. It stays a different field from `applies_when`: it says who levies
 * the tax, which is a term of the invoice and of a report, where `applies_when`
 * says when the tax can be reached at all. `US-P-0` is the case that keeps them
 * apart — a purchase not subject to the tax, levied by nobody, recorded against
 * the state whose return it belongs to.
 *
 * The third is about the seller only. A pack is keyed on the country its
 * companies file under, so a tax of that pack is a tax its seller owes: a
 * `seller_in` outside the pack's country is a pack claiming another country's
 * law. The buyer and the place of supply are deliberately unconstrained —
 * a supply is taxed where it lands, and where it lands is the whole point.
