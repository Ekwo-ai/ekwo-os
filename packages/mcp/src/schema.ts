/**
 * What this server needs of the database it is pointed at.
 *
 * An MCP client is installed by whoever wants an assistant, and the database
 * it reaches was installed by whoever runs the books — two decisions, two
 * dates. So the server asks the schema its version before it answers anything,
 * and refuses one it is too new for, by name. The alternative is what an
 * assistant does with a missing column: it improvises, and the improvisation
 * is an accounting entry.
 *
 * Declared in `package.json` under `ekwo.schemaMin`, as a country pack
 * declares it in its manifest, and repeated here as a constant so a bundle
 * that never reads a manifest still carries it.
