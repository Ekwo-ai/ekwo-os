/**
 * The schema version this package is written against.
 *
 * A country pack declares `schema_min` in its manifest, and for the same
 * reason a published npm package has to: the rows it reads and the functions
 * it calls are a contract with a version of the database, and installing a
 * newer client against an older database is the one upgrade order nobody
 * plans for. The number is declared in `package.json` under `ekwo.schemaMin`
 * and repeated here as a constant, so a bundler that never reads a manifest
 * still carries it; a test keeps the two equal.
 *
 * Forward only. A release of Ekwo is a tag carrying migrations, packs and
 * packages together; there is no "down" migration and there never will be,
 * because undoing a schema change on a database with a year of entries in it
 * is not a script, it is a restore.
