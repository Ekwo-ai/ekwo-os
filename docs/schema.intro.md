# Schema

The reference half of this document is generated from the migrations, so it
cannot drift from what the database actually holds. Regenerate it with
`node scripts/generate-schema-doc.mjs`.

## Shape

One installation belongs to one customer. That is why there is no `tenant_id`
anywhere: the instance is the tenant, and `instance` records it in a single
row written by the installer.

```
instance                                 one row: who installed it, where, which edition
instance_admins                          instance administrators
companies ─┬─ company_members            who may read or write, in three roles
           ├─ fiscal_years               periods, open or closed
           ├─ accounts                   chart of accounts, eighteen types
           ├─ journals ── journal_sequences

           ├─ taxes ── tax_postings      ledger account and VAT box, per tax
           ├─ entries ── entry_lines     the ledger; the lines carry the truth
           ├─ documents ── document_lines invoices, credit notes, quotes
           ├─ payments                   money in and out
           ├─ reconciliations            bilateral matching, by amount
           ├─ bank_accounts ── bank_statements ── bank_transactions

```

Reference data sits outside any company: `currencies`, `currency_rates`, and
the four template tables plus `country_defaults` that
`install_country_template()` copies into a new company.

## Six rules the schema enforces

1. **Amounts are positive.** `entry_lines` refuses a negative debit or credit
   and refuses a line carrying both. A reversal flips the side.
2. **A posted entry balances.** A check constraint on `entries`, with
   `total_debit` and `total_credit` maintained from the lines by trigger.
3. **Totals are derived.** `document_lines.amount_untaxed` is generated;
   document and entry totals are maintained by trigger; `documents.amount_paid`
   is recomputed from the matching on the third-party lines. Nothing is keyed
   in.
4. **A locked period refuses writes.** Triggers on `entries` and
   `entry_lines` consult `companies.lock_date`, `companies.tax_lock_date` and
   `fiscal_years.is_closed`. Matching stays allowed.
5. **A third-party account is reconcilable.** A check constraint refuses an
   `asset_receivable` or `liability_payable` account that is not.
6. **Every table has row level security.** At instance level, a row in
   `instance_admins` creates companies and invites members. Per company, `company_members` gives `viewer` read, `accountant`
   write, and `owner` administration of the company and its members. An
   instance administrator can see the list of companies and invite people
   into them; they cannot read a ledger they were not invited to.
7. **The instance row is a singleton.** A primary key of `1` and a check
   constraint make a second row impossible, not merely unusual.

## Registration is opt-in

`instance.contact_email` and `instance.registered_at` are empty on a fresh
install. Nothing writes them unless the operator calls `register_instance()`,
nothing in this repository reads them, and `unregister_instance()` puts them
back. Community works unregistered, forever. `instance.edition` records
whether Ekwo operates the installation; it gates nothing here.

## Account types

Eighteen values, grouped by the prefix before the first underscore, which is
what `internal_group` derives:

| Group | Types |
|---|---|
| `asset` | `asset_receivable`, `asset_cash`, `asset_current`, `asset_prepayments`, `asset_fixed`, `asset_non_current` |
| `liability` | `liability_payable`, `liability_credit_card`, `liability_current`, `liability_non_current` |
| `equity` | `equity`, `equity_retained` |
| `income` | `income`, `income_other` |
| `expense` | `expense`, `expense_direct_cost`, `expense_depreciation` |
| `off_balance` | `off_balance` |

`carries_forward` is generated too: true for everything except the income and
expense types.

## How a tax lands

A tax says how much. Its postings say where.

For each tax and each document kind (`invoice` or `credit_note`), `tax_postings`
holds at most one `base` posting and any number of `tax` postings. Each one
carries a `factor_percent`, a ledger account (for tax postings) and a
`declaration_box` with its own `box_factor_percent`.

`post_document()` applies them:

- the base amount goes to the account of the document line, and picks up the
  box of the base posting;
- for each tax posting, `round(tax x |factor| / 100, 2)` goes to that
  posting's account — on the same side as the base when `factor_percent` is
  positive, on the opposite side when it is negative;
- the declaration box receives `round(tax x box_factor / 100, 2)`,
  independently of which side the ledger amount landed on.

A Belgian intra-community purchase of goods at 21 % is therefore four rows:

| kind | type | factor | account | box | box factor |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| invoice | base | 100 | — | 86 | 100 |
| invoice | tax | 100 | 411000 recoverable | 59 | 100 |
| invoice | tax | −100 | 451000 payable | 55 | 100 |

which books `604 debit 1000 / 411 debit 210 / 451 credit 210 / 440 credit 1000`,
fills boxes 86, 59 and 55, and leaves the supplier owed 1 000. The ledger and
the return say the same thing, because they are the same rows.

## Posting a document

`post_document(document_id)` in order:

1. refuses a document that is already posted, cancelled, empty, or a quote;
2. refuses a tax that is not in force on the accounting date, or a
   fixed-amount tax;
3. checks the period is open;
4. writes one base line per `(account, tax)` pair;
5. writes the tax lines, grouping the basis per tax and rounding once;
6. writes the third-party counterpart as the difference of everything above,
   with `date_maturity` from the due date or the contact's payment terms;
7. raises if that counterpart disagrees with the document total by more than
   half a cent — the ledger is right by construction, so the header is what is
   wrong;
8. numbers and posts the entry, and points the document at it.
